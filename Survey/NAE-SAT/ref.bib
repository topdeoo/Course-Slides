  abstract = {In the paper, we study the Maximum Satisfiability and the Partial Maximum Satisfiability problems. Using Gallai–Edmonds decomposition, we significantly improve the upper bound for the Maximum Satisfiability problem parameterized above maximum matching in the variable-clause graph. Our algorithm operates with a runtime of O∗(2.83k), a substantial improvement compared to the previous approach requiring O∗(4k), where k denotes the relevant parameter. Moreover, this result immediately implies O∗(1.14977m) and O∗(1.27895m) time algorithms for the (n, 3)-MaxSAT and (n, 4)-MaxSAT where m is the overall number of clauses. These upper bounds improve prior-known upper bounds equal to O∗(1.1554m) and O∗(1.2872m). We also adapt the algorithm so that it can handle instances of Partial Maximum Satisfiability without losing performance in some cases. Note that this is somewhat surprising, as the existence of even one hard clause can significantly increase the hardness of a problem.},

  abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most prominent proposed applications for near-term quantum computing. Here we study the ability of QAOA to solve hard constraint satisfaction problems, as opposed to optimization problems. We focus on the fundamental boolean satisfiability problem, in the form of random k-SAT. We develop analytic bounds on the average success probability of QAOA over random boolean formulae at the satisfiability threshold, as the number of variables n goes to infinity. The bounds hold for fixed parameters and when k is a power of 2. We complement these theoretical results with numerical results on the performance of QAOA for small n, showing that these match the limiting theoretical bounds closely. We then use these results to compare QAOA with leading classical solvers. In the case of random 8-SAT, we find that for around 14 ansatz layers, QAOA matches the scaling performance of the highest-performance classical solver we tested, WalkSATlm. For larger numbers of layers, QAOA outperforms WalkSATlm, with an ultimate level of advantage that is still to be determined. Our methods provide a framework for analysing the performance of QAOA for hard constraint satisfaction problems and finding further speedups over classical algorithms.},

  abstract = {MAX NAE-SAT is a natural optimization problem, closely related to its better-known relative MAX SAT. The approximability status of MAX NAE-SAT is almost completely understood if all clauses have the same size \$k\$, for some \$k\textbackslash ge 2\$. We refer to this problem as MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{k\textbackslash\}\$-SAT. For \$k=2\$, it is essentially the celebrated MAX CUT problem. For \$k=3\$, it is related to the MAX CUT problem in graphs that can be fractionally covered by triangles. For \$k\textbackslash ge 4\$, it is known that an approximation ratio of \$1-\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\textasciicircum\{k-1\}\}\$, obtained by choosing a random assignment, is optimal, assuming \$P\textbackslash ne NP\$. For every \$k\textbackslash ge 2\$, an approximation ratio of at least \$\textbackslash frac\{7\}\{8\}\$ can be obtained for MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{k\textbackslash\}\$-SAT. There was some hope, therefore, that there is also a \$\textbackslash frac\{7\}\{8\}\$-approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, where clauses of all sizes are allowed simultaneously. Our main result is that there is no \$\textbackslash frac\{7\}\{8\}\$-approximation algorithm for MAX NAE-SAT, assuming the unique games conjecture (UGC). In fact, even for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{3,5\textbackslash\}\$-SAT (i.e., MAX NAE-SAT where all clauses have size \$3\$ or \$5\$), the best approximation ratio that can be achieved, assuming UGC, is at most \$\textbackslash frac\{3(\textbackslash sqrt\{21\}-4)\}\{2\}\textbackslash approx 0.8739\$. Using calculus of variations, we extend the analysis of O'Donnell and Wu for MAX CUT to MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{3\textbackslash\}\$-SAT. We obtain an optimal algorithm, assuming UGC, for MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{3\textbackslash\}\$-SAT, slightly improving on previous algorithms. The approximation ratio of the new algorithm is \$\textbackslash approx 0.9089\$. We complement our theoretical results with some experimental results. We describe an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-\$\textbackslash\{3,5\textbackslash\}\$-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8728, and an approximation algorithm for almost satisfiable instances of MAX NAE-SAT with a conjectured approximation ratio of 0.8698.},

The works of Ding, Sly, Sun (2014, 2016) and Coja-Oghlan, Panagiotou (2014) established the satisfiability threshold for random regular \$k\$-NAE-SAT, random \$k\$-SAT, and random regular \$k\$-SAT for large enough \$k\textbackslash geq k\_0\$ where \$k\_0\$ is a large non-explicit constant. Establishing the same for small values of \$k\textbackslash geq 3\$ remains an important open problem in the study of random CSPs. In this work, we study two closely related models of random CSPs, namely the \$2\$-coloring on random \$d\$-regular \$k\$-uniform hypergraphs and the random \$d\$-regular \$k\$-NAE-SAT model. For every \$k\textbackslash geq 3\$, we prove that there is an explicit \$d\_\{\textbackslash ast\}(k)\$ which gives a satisfiability upper bound for both of the models. Our upper bound \$d\_\{\textbackslash ast\}(k)\$ for \$k\textbackslash geq 3\$ matches the prediction from statistical physics for the hypergraph \$2\$-coloring by Dall'Asta, Ramezanpour, Zecchina (2008), thus conjectured to be sharp. Moreover, \$d\_\{\textbackslash ast\}(k)\$ coincides with the satisfiability threshold of random regular \$k\$-NAE-SAT for large enough \$k\textbackslash geq k\_0\$ by Ding, Sly, Sun (2014).},

We focus on regimes where the problems are known to have solutions with low probability and introduce a novel classical solver that outperforms existing solvers. Extensively benchmarking QAOA against this, we show that while the runtime of both solvers scales exponentially with the problem size, the scaling exponent for QAOA is smaller for large enough circuit depths.

Our solver is able to utilize circuit topological information and signal correlations to enforce a decision ordering that is more efficient for solving circuit-based SAT problem instances.

In fact, in random regular k-NAE-SAT, which is one of such random CSPs, it was verified \textbackslash cite\{ssz22\} that its free energy is well-defined and the explicit value follows the 1RSB prediction. However, for any model of sparse random CSP, it has been unknown whether the solution space indeed condenses on O(1) clusters according to the 1RSB prediction. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question for the random regular k-NAE-SAT model. Namely, we prove that with probability bounded away from zero, most of the solutions lie inside a bounded number of solution clusters whose sizes are comparable to the scale of the free energy. Furthermore, we establish that the overlap between two independently drawn solutions concentrates precisely at two values. Our proof is based on a detailed moment analysis of a spin system, which has an infinite spin space that encodes the structure of solution clusters. We believe that our method is applicable to a broad range of random CSPs in the 1RSB universality class.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, we have seen a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of conflict-driven clause-learning Boolean satisfiability (CDCL SAT) solvers on industrial problems from a variety of domains. The availability of such powerful general-purpose search tools as SAT solvers has led many researchers to propose SATbased methods for cryptanalysis, including techniques for finding collisions in hash functions and breaking symmetric encryption schemes. Most of the previously proposed SAT-based cryptanalysis approaches are blackbox techniques, in the sense that the cryptanalysis problem is encoded as a SAT instance and then a CDCL SAT solver is invoked to solve the said instance. A weakness of this approach is that the encoding thus generated may be too large for any modern solver to solve efficiently. Perhaps a more important weakness of this approach is that the solver is in no way specialized or tuned to solve the given instance. To address these issues, we propose an approach called CDCL(Crypto) (inspired by the CDCL(T ) paradigm in Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers) to tailor the internal subroutines of the CDCL SAT solver with domain-specific knowledge about cryptographic primitives. Specifically, we extend the propagation and conflict analysis subroutines of CDCL solvers with specialized codes that have knowledge about the cryptographic primitive being analyzed by the solver. We demonstrate the power of this approach in the differential path and algebraic fault analysis of hash functions. Our initial results are very encouraging and reinforce the notion that this approach is a significant improvement over blackbox SAT-based cryptanalysis.},

The reduction used gives rise to the complexity investigation of both variants for several monotone linear subclasses that are parameterized by the size of clauses or by the number of occurrences of variables. In particular cases of these parameter values we are able to verify the NP-completeness of XSAT respectively NAE-SAT; though we cannot provide a complete treatment. Finally we focus on exact linear formulas where clauses intersect pairwise, and for which SAT is known to be polynomial-time solvable [1]. We verify the same assertion for NAE-SAT relying on a result in [2]; whereas we obtain NP-completeness for XSAT of exact linear formulas.

Work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, M\textbackslash "\{u\}ller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold. Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation \$O(n\textasciicircum\{-1/2\})\$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.},

  abstract = {Cryptography ensures the confidentiality and authenticity of information but often relies on unproven assumptions. SAT solvers are a powerful tool to test the hardness of certain problems and have successfully been used to test hardness assumptions. This paper extends a SAT solver to efficiently work on cryptographic problems. The paper further illustrates how SAT solvers process cryptographic functions using automatically generated visualizations, introduces techniques for simplifying the solving process by modifying cipher representations, and demonstrates the feasibility of the approach by solving three stream ciphers.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses a key aspect of efficient computation in logic synthesis and formal verification, namely, the integration of a circuit simulator and a Boolean satisfiability solver. A novel way of interfacing these is proposed along with a fast preprocessing step to detect easy SAT instances and a new hybrid SAT solver, which is more robust for hardware designs than are state-of-the-art CNFbased solvers. The proposed integration enables a 10x speedup in essential computation engines widely used in industrial EDA tools, including SAT sweeping, combinational and sequential equivalence checking, and computing structural choices for technology mapping. The speedup does not lead to a loss in quality because the computed equivalences are canonical.},

  abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},
