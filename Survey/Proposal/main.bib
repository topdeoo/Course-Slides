abstract = {Restart-based Branch-and-Bound Search (BBS) is a standard algorithm for solving Constraint Optimization Problems (COPs). In this paper, we propose an approach to find good partial assignments to jumpstart search at each restart for general COPs, which are identified by comparing different best solutions found in different restart runs. We consider information extracted from historical solutions to evaluate the quality of the partial assignments. Thus the good partial assignments are dynamically updated as the current best solution evolves. Our approach makes restart-based BBS explore different promising sub-search-spaces to find high-quality solutions. Experiments on the MiniZinc benchmark suite show how our approach brings significant improvements to a blackbox COP solver equipped with the state of the art search techniques. Our method finds better solutions and proves optimality for more instances.},

isbn = {9781577356332},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms can efficiently find models of satisfiable formulae for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. There has been much interest in studying SLS algorithms on random k-SAT instances. Compared to random 3-SAT instances which have special statistical properties rendering them easy to solve, random k-SAT instances with long clauses are similar to structured ones and remain very difficult. This paper is devoted to efficient SLS algorithms for random k-SAT instances with long clauses. By combining a novel variable property subscore with the commonly used property score, we design a scoring function named comprehensive score, which is utilized to develop a new SLS algorithm called CScoreSAT. The experiments show that CScoreSAT outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers, including the winners of recent SAT competitions, by one to two orders of magnitudes on large random 5-SAT and 7-SAT instances. In addition, CScoreSAT significantly outperforms its competitors on random k-SAT instances for each k = 4; 5; 6; 7 from SAT Challenge 2012, which indicates its robustness.},

  abstract = {Two competing approaches to handling complex constraints in satisfaction and optimization problems using SAT and LCG/SMT technology are: decompose the complex constraint into a set of clauses; or (theory) propagate the complex constraint using a standalone algorithm and explain the propagation. Each approach has its benefits. The decomposition approach is prone to an explosion in size to represent the problem, while the propagation approach may require exponentially more search since it does not have access to intermediate literals for explanation. In this paper we show how we can obtain the best of both worlds by lazily decomposing a complex constraint propagator using conflicts to direct it. If intermediate literals are not helpful for conflicts then it will act like the propagation approach, but if they are helpful it will act like the decomposition approach. Experimental results show that it is never much worse than the better of the decomposition and propagation approaches, and sometimes better than both.},
